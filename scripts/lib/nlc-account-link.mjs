// Security-critical account-link decision logic for nlc-session.
//
// Threat: NLC identity can be phone-primary, so the email in a Logto token is not
// guaranteed to be a verified, caller-owned address. Linking an incoming login to
// an existing profile by email alone must therefore NEVER escalate privilege — or
// an attacker with a token bearing an admin's email could inherit that admin role.
//
// `linkedBy` describes HOW the existing profile was matched:
//   "identity"  — matched by Logto sub (strong; the caller proved this identity)
//   "member_id" — matched by NLC member id from the authenticated Hub context (strong)
//   "email"     — matched only by email (WEAK; may not be caller-owned)
//   "none"      — no existing profile (new account, keyed by the strong Logto sub)
//
// This module is pure and unit-tested. Keep it in sync with the copy in
// supabase/functions/nlc-session/index.ts (Deno cannot import this Node .mjs directly).
